## Story
This was the first project where I have collected the data myself.  
Although, it was a manual process from Billboard's website saving directly into an Excel file.  

At this point though, I did not know what I would like to visualize.  
After figuring it out, I needed the data in another format, so I rubbed my hands together that FINALLY I can use some SQL for problem solving.

Attached you will find the original dataset and here the process I did for wrangling the data into the desired shape.
